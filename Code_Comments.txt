  Fixed:
  - It was found that Scope C# applications allow only one UDP connection
    This problem was solved by capturing the exception on Scope - UDP connect, and then displaying a message explaining the error condition, 
    with a recommendation to uncheck the UDB box in the Scope form.

Igor adjusted TableLayoutPanel_Main and how it changed          private void PageControl_Main_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
(still does not work for performance panel - the top raw height is set to zero, so on left panel too. Logo disappears, Panel_menu jumps up.

Amit Kamat from Ametek India converted VB6 to C#

2017-02-08
Modified formFilters - added NI numeric controls replacing textbox place holders
IK: LOOK FOR COMMENT "//-!-" - I commented line temporarely to compile (for example function call, and function is not transfered to C# yet)
>>>TO DO>>> Program.Init_sys_data might need to be replaced with Program.IsReadingControllerSettings
>>>TO DO>>> remove namespace Microsoft.VisualBasic, replace VB-like calls with C# calls, i.e. "Strings.Mid(response, sep_pos + 1)" with "response.Substring(sep_pos + 1)"

Using Win XP TOSHIBA laptop,
Imported VB6 project.
It imports into VS 2003 and SHOWS all controls, including NI.ComponetWorks (did not attempt to debug)
It imports into VS 2008 and SHOWS controls, NOT including NI.ComponetWorks. Forms with NI controls cannot be open in designer.
Created C# project and added forms (manually). Renamed them as if for MAg-NEtX_NET project.
From VS 2008 imported VB files on the forms which CAN be open (without NI controls) copied "design" - open "form view" in VB.NET project, copy to clipboard,
open "form view" in C#, pasted to C# form. IT GREATLY SPEEDS UP LAYOUT TRANSFER!
